We reverse engineered the software for 2take1. I don't need a license! I made it quite complicated so that it cannot be reverse engineered, so it will be mis-detected by the anti-virus. Be sure to turn off your anti-virus and launch GTA5.exe before opening it!
More optimized crash protection
Rejects incoming connections from modders who try to crash you and only allows outgoing connections from 2take1 users. Sends an abnormal number of peds and objects back to the modder. Modders who try to crash you will crash themselves. 2take1 now handles Casino Heist's infinite load screen. 2take1 now includes some stand menu protection.
This also gives us fine control over crashes caused by GTA5 loading and lettering.
external protection has limitations, so it is now an internal hack
Fixed a problem with many internal hacks that caused the hack software itself to crash. The hack software ignores the crash issue. Added the ability to reinject cheats in-game. Re-injection time 5-10 seconds GTA5 restart not required
Status:Undetected
